## Requirements

* Read JSON files of trip data sampled at 1 Hz.
* Visualize trips on a map.
* Visualize distribution of speed along a trip.
* Data must be read / processed client-sided.

## TODO:

* Define sample frequency for plotting speeds (more than once per minute)
* Make everything a little more responsive
* Possibly look into better styling...
